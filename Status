  Start to define the register specification for Texture unit, Vertex Shader, Vertex Streamer. 
  Start and finish the RTL coding for register block of Texture Unit.
* 08.19.2014
  Start the RTL coding for the Vertex Streamer 
  LineCount=3514
* 08.20.2014
  Finish the most part the Vertex Streamer, starting the RTL coding for StreamerFetch in Streamer. 
  Since the Streamer will send StreamerControlCommand to SFT and SLU or other subblocks and the SFT can aslo send the StreamerControlCommand to SLU, there should be a broadcast bus in the Streamer to chain the subblocks. 
  Each block has receiver and transmitter. If the dest_id is the block, it will receive the request.
  Need to finish the SFT subblock specification and diagram.

  Finish the Command Broadcast Bus with AXI protocol.
  Start the RTL coding for Command Processor receiving AGP transaction from CPU.  Start the Specification of CP. 
  LineCount=4900
* 08.22.2014
  Continue the RTL coding for Command Processor. All the register via AGP arriving CP will dispatch to different blocks. The relation is 1 to N.
  Continue the CP specification.

  Start the Command Processor RTL verification via UVM from Mentor Graphics. 
  Register address space is done in GART_GPU_register.xlsx in Register Address Space tab.

  CmdProcessor 's UVM TB is already. However, the RTL debug is very complex and tedious. One time over one time. 
 *08.27.2014
   CmdProcessor register dispatch is OK. Focus on the memory request path.

  I never have the experience in the parallel logic design and architecture. Now the ShaderFetch is the such architecture. Interesting!
  Study the ShaderFetch,ShaderInstruction,ShaderEmulator. Learning process is very hard since you are absorbing new knowledge.

  Shader Input RTL coding for NEW_PROGRAM command received fro Command processor and send AXI memory request to MC and load the data into the 64MB instruction memory.  Wait the UVM TB to verify
  LineCount=6954
* 09.03.2014
  Debug the UVM TB to verify the Shader Fetch. 
  UVMLineCount=1433
* 09.04.2014
  Shader.ShaderFetch.AXI(MC) is done.
  Shader.ShaderFetch.AHB(NEW_PROGRAM) is done
  Shader.ShaderFetch.AHB(ShaderInput) is doing.
* 09.05.2014
  Shader Fetch has many threads forming a group. Each thread has the PC, how to map the PC to the ShaderInput is a question.
* 09.10.2014
  Rewrite the Shader Fetch thread table control logic with main-child FSM
